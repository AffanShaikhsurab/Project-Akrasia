## üìö About Project Akrasia

### What is Project Akrasia?

Project Akrasia is a non-profit, open-source initiative focused on helping people‚Äîespecially students‚Äîunderstand and overcome procrastination. The term "Akrasia" comes from ancient Greek philosophy and refers to the state of acting against one's better judgment, which perfectly describes the procrastination experience.

### Why is it called "Akrasia"?

Akrasia (·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒ±œÉŒØŒ±) is an ancient Greek term coined by Aristotle that describes the phenomenon of acting against one's better judgment. It's the perfect word for procrastination‚Äîwhen we know what we should do but find ourselves doing something else instead. This philosophical foundation helps us approach procrastination not as a moral failing, but as a universal human experience that can be understood and addressed.

### Who is behind Project Akrasia?

Project Akrasia is a community-driven initiative started by individuals who have personally struggled with procrastination and want to help others. Our team includes:
- Developers and designers
- Mental health professionals
- Researchers and academics
- Educators and students
- People who have overcome procrastination challenges

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds who share our mission.

### Is Project Akrasia affiliated with any organization?

Project Akrasia is an independent, non-profit initiative. While we collaborate with researchers, mental health professionals, and educational institutions, we maintain our independence to ensure our content remains unbiased and focused solely on helping users.
